**Title:** Examining Comprehension of Meta-Analytic Effect Estimates: A Mixed-Methods Study of a Nationally Representative Sample of United States Adults <br>
**OSF Component:** <https://osf.io/hefr7> <br> 
**Package Author:** Shaina Trevino 



## **🔹 Overview**
This folder contains the replication materials for the following publication:  

Day, E., Trevino, S. D.,  Chinn, L. K., Grant, S., Schweer-Collins, M., & Tanner-Smith, E. E. (under review). Examining Comprehension of Meta-Analytic Effect Estimates: A Mixed-Methods Study of a Nationally Representative Sample of United States Adults. Public Understanding of Science.

This replication package follows **[AEA Data and Code Availability Standards](https://datacodestandard.org/)** and includes:
- Datasets used to generate reported results.
- R code necessary to reproduce quantitative results reported.
- Computational environment details to ensure reproducibility.


## **🔹 Data and Code Availability Statement**
### **Data Sources**
The data used in this publication were collected by the authors specifically for this study using an online survey administered to a nationally representative sample recruited via Prolific.
- Metadata (variable names and descriptions) are provided in the `data` subfolder in the `Codebook.xlsx` file.

The following datasets used for analyses are available in the `data` subfolder:

| Data File | Description | Data Structure |
|-----------|-------------|-----------| 
| `Cleaned demographic data 6.4.csv` | De-identified participant demographic file| One row per participant | 
| `Cleaned full data 6.2.24.csv` | De-identified analytic dataset of survey responses| One row per participant |
| `Codebook.xlsx` | Metadata (variable names, descriptions, options) for both data files | One row per variable | 
<br>

### **Analysis Script**
The analysis script used to generate quantitative results for this publication is an `Rmarkdown` file in the `code` subfolder (`Cleaning_Analysis_Script.Rmd`). 

### **Data Citation**

## **🔹 Instructions for Replication**

### **Data Preparation and Analysis**
To replicate our results: 

**If you have Rstudio and Git installed and connected to your GitHub account:**

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/HEDCO-Institute/Transformed_ES_Comprehension_Publication) to your local machine ([click for help](https://book.cds101.com/using-rstudio-server-to-clone-a-github-repo-as-a-new-project.html#step---2))
1. Open the `Transformed_ES_Comprehension_Publication.Rproj` R project in R Studio (this should automatically activate the `renv` environment)
1. Navigate to the `code` folder
1. Run the `Cleaning_Analysis_Script.Rmd` script section by section to compare results

**If you need to install or connect R, Rstudio, Git, and/or GitHub:**

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#github-acct)
1. [Install R and RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html)
1. [Install Git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)
1. [Link Git to your GitHub account](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)
1. [Sign into GitHub in Rstudio](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html)

**To reproduce our results without using Git and GitHub, you may use the following steps:** 

1. Download the ZIP file from the [repository](https://github.com/HEDCO-Institute/Transformed_ES_Comprehension_Publication)
1. Extract all files to your local machine
1. Open the `Transformed_ES_Comprehension_Publication.Rproj` R project in R Studio (this will automatically set the working directory and activate the `renv` environment)
1. Navigate to the `code` folder
1. Run the `Cleaning_Analysis_Script.Rmd` script 


## **🔹 Notes on Reproducibility**
- All file paths are relative; no hardcoded paths are used.
- Data cleaning and analyses are fully automated in the provided `.Rmd` analysis script.

### **Non-Reproducible Elements**
Some components cannot be reproduced using the analysis script:
- Qualitative findings are not generated by the analysis script. 
- Table 1 and Table 3 were manually created in Word and are not generated by the analysis script.
- Figure 1 was generated in another software and is not generated by the analysis script. 

### **Known Discrepancies**
At this time, there are no known discrepancies between results from the analysis script and those reported in the publication/preprint.


## **🔹 Computational Requirements**
### **Software Environment**
- **R Version:** 4.2.2  
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 Enterprise (x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64)  

### **Reproducing the Environment**
Opening the `Transformed_ES_Comprehension_Publication` R project will automatically install the correct package versions and set up the environment using the `renv` package. To manually load the environment:

1. Install `renv` (if not already installed):
```r
if (!requireNamespace("renv", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("renv")
```

2. Restore any missing packages:
```r
renv::restore()
```

3. If needed, load the environment:
```r
renv::load()
```

Once the environment is restored, run the script starting with loading the necessary packages.
